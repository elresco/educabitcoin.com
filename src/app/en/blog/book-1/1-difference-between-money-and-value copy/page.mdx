## The 3 property problem

Let's think about a town and a neighberhood with 3 owners.

To make it simple lets call them Owner1, Owner2 and Owner3.
The properties have the same features and they have a value of $100 each one.

The 3 owners want to sell their homes so they put ads for $100.

In a less than a week a buyer called Buyer1 comes to town. 
He has contacts within the goverment and has access to the money printer.
He then gets a load $100 freshly printed with no interest. With his full pokes ask to buy Owner1 property.

To make it simple, let's asume we don't have taxes nor fees.

After Owner1 sold his home in no time the other two owners raise the prices to $110.

Second buyer called Buyer2 does the same as Buyer1, gets the fresh money and in a few days purchases Owner2 home for $110, again no interests.

Owner3 rises prices to $120 and quickly finds a buyer that does the same as the previous one.

Now pause and try to answer the following questions.

#### Who won more?

Obviously, I can't predict your answer but based in my experence most people will answer
that Owner3 was the winner here after all he sold his home for $120 and the other two sold too early.

If your answer was Buyer1 you are in the proper path, let's see the reasoning behind it.

After the whole operation, owners want to buy stuff with his new adquired money, to make it simple there's
no other asset than more properties in this town.

Now the entire town homes have a value of $130, so Owner3 will trade his $120 home for another with the more price.
He's in fact no winner, he's just under the market.

Let's try to answer another question that will help us unravel this puzzle

#### Who lose more?

Some may say that Buyer3 lose the most because he bougth a more expensive asset than the other 2 buyers.
But in fact his balance sheet is positive since his home is now valued at $130 against his $120 loan.

The proper answer is Owner1. 

Owner1 sold for $100 and assets are now $130, so he lost $30 in the process.

#### Then, who is the winner?

Now that we understand who lost the most we can point to the actual winner, Buyer1.
He got a $100 loan and now his asset is valued at $130, so he's on the positve side.

### Value vs monetary unit

With this simple exercice you can teach others what is the main difference between real value
and monetary value.

A price tag is just an information exchange to trade two items.

So, the real value is the asset not the price tag assosiated with it.

It's true that money can be in some cases just another asset.
But that makes everything more complex since money can be created out of thin air,
it makes all price comparision not only useless but harming.

Useless because their are not totally true to reallity.
Harming because you plan your entire life based on a number that is just wrong.

Fluctuating money is just evil and makes exchanges extremely hard.

### Introducing Cantillion Effect

Simplified, this is how inflation works. The proper name for it is Cantillion Effect
and understanding this is the key to unravel the money problem we face today.

In real life this idea is extremely hard to see since we don't have a unique asset class,
each class have. 

Different asset are more resistant to inflation due to different factors.

The main factor is how their are able to retain their value.

The way to retain value for an asset is to be hard to replicate and hard to be spolied or destroyed.

We will talk about value more deeply later in the book.

Hence, the more common an asset is it will be least impacted by inflation since producers can fill the market with more of them.

However, the more scarce an asset is the harder to create new ones. So the newly artificial demand
created by the money printer will not be supplied rising the prices.

We can deduct this idea using common sense.
A person or family that accumulates more assets don't increase the number of basic consumer goods they need by a much.

Instead they will increase the prices of luxury foods and luxury clothes brands.

### Using inprecise measure units

Imagine being an architect and that your meter or inch fluctuates over time.

How would you successfuly plan your new building? 

Put it simple, you can NOT. It tramsforms trivial calculations into ritualistic shamanistic predictions and hundreds of people trying to sell courses online on how to make more money following esoteric lines.

So, if our price value is not a real unit of account and it fluctuates with time.
How wrong are all our economic predictions and analysis?
