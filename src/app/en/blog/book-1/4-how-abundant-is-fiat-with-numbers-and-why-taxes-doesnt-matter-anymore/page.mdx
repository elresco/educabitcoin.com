## CPI is just a lie

Now that we know the basics of the Cantillion Effect we can talk about CPI indicators.

We learnt that when money is printed it affects luxury items the most and common
consumer goods are not more demanded by the new inflow of money added to the market.

With this in mind almost all countries implement a way to measure the inflation of their currency.

The method to calculate the index varies between countries but they usually follow the same pattern.

The pick a bunch of basic consumer goods and compare the prices between dates.

Yes, the same consumer goods we learnt they are least affected by new money added to the market.

This makes this indicator not only evil and missleading but useless.

### Central Bank of Swizerland

The Central Bank of Swizerland is a special one, this national bank is not fully owned by the state but 
rather has public stock, 78% is owned by several Swiss entities and the rest is traded among private owners.



When I moved to Switzerland to back in 2021, 1 Euro was worth 1.11 Swiss Franks.
While writing this in 2024, 1 Euro is worth 0.94 Swiss Franks.

2008 aug 1 euro was 0.66 franks
2008 aug money supply was 438k

2022 jan 1 euro was 1.02 franks
2022 jan money supply was 1.09 million million

aprox cpi 8.73

time to cut in half is 8.24 years


With an initial investment of â‚¬569 growing to â‚¬1184 over the same period, the annual compound interest rate would be approximately 4.69%. At this rate, it would take about 15.36 years for the initial investment to double


### Growth is just another lie

After we unravel this simple fact, we can start unveiling lies that we had
implemented in our brains since we where born.

When someone invest on a company and they earn 5%, they are in fact earning money but
losing value.
